# TravelEasyHai – Seat Sharing Platform ( Next.js )

## 📌 Project Overview

TravelEasyHai is a **Next.js-based seat-sharing web application** focused on helping users share available seats for a trip. Instead of booking a full vehicle, passengers can **join only the seats that are free**, making travel more affordable and efficient.

This platform connects travelers going on the same route and makes transportation more convenient through **community-based seat sharing**.
